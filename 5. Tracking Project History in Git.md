## **üéØ Step-by-Step Guide to Tracking History**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Viewing Commit History**

To see the full history of your project, use:

```sh
git log
```

This will display:

- Commit hash (unique ID)
- Author
- Date
- Commit message

**Example Output:**

```
commit 3f2c1e57d1234abc12d4567e89f000abc1234567
Author: John Doe <john@example.com>
Date:   Mon Mar 18 10:00:00 2024 +0000

    Fixed the bug in authentication
```

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Viewing a Concise History**

If you want a one-line summary per commit:

```sh
git log --oneline
```

**Example Output:**

```
3f2c1e5 Fixed the bug in authentication
1a2b3c4 Updated README file
d4e5f6a Initial commit
```

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Checking Who Modified a Specific File**

To find out who last modified a file and when:

```sh
git blame <file>
```

This shows each line of the file with the commit that last modified it.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Viewing Changes Between Commits**

To see what changed between two commits:

```sh
git diff <commit1> <commit2>
```

Example:

```sh
git diff 3f2c1e5 1a2b3c4
```

This will output the differences between the two commits.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Viewing Changes Before Committing**

To check changes before adding them to the staging area:

```sh
git diff
```

To check changes in the staging area before committing:

```sh
git diff --staged
```

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Showing a Specific Commit‚Äôs Details**

To inspect what happened in a particular commit:

```sh
git show <commit>
```

Example:

```sh
git show 3f2c1e5
```

This will display the commit details along with file changes.

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Viewing Project History as a Graph**

A graphical view of branches and commits:

```sh
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
```

This shows commits in a structured way with branches.

---

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Searching Through Commit Messages**

To find commits containing a specific word:

```sh
git log --grep="bug fix"
```

This will show commits where the message includes "bug fix".

---

## **üìå Best Practices for Tracking History**

‚úÖ Write **clear commit messages**  
‚úÖ Use **meaningful commit history** instead of large single commits  
‚úÖ Regularly **push your changes** to keep history updated  
‚úÖ Use `git log` and `git blame` to **audit changes**
