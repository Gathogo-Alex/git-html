When working on a software project, you will often need to manage multiple versions simultaneously. For example:

- A **stable version** for users (e.g., "Production" or `main` branch)
- A **development version** where new features are tested
- Temporary versions for **bug fixes**, **experimental features**, or **older releases**

Git makes it easy to manage these different versions using **branches, tags, and remote repositories**.

# **1️⃣ Understanding Versions in Git**

Before diving into commands, let’s define some key concepts:

### **📌 Branches**

A **branch** is a separate line of development.

- The `main` branch (or `master` in older Git versions) is the default branch, typically used for stable releases.
- Other branches allow developers to work on **new features**, **bug fixes**, or **experimental changes** without affecting the stable version.

### **📌 Tags**

A **tag** is like a bookmark that marks an important point in your project history (e.g., "Version 1.0").

- Unlike branches, **tags do not change** once created.
- Used for **version releases**, like `v1.0`, `v2.0.1`, etc.

### **📌 Remote Repositories**

A **remote repository** is a version of your project stored on a hosting service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

- You **push** (upload) changes to remote repositories.
- You **pull** (download) updates from them.

# **2️⃣ Using Branches for Versioning**

### **🔹 Checking Available Branches**

```sh
git branch
```

This shows all local branches and highlights the current branch.

### **🔹 Creating a New Branch**

```sh
git branch feature-x
```

This creates a new branch called `feature-x` but does **not** switch to it.

### **🔹 Switching to Another Branch**

```sh
git switch feature-x
```

or

```sh
git checkout feature-x  # Older method
```

Now you are working on `feature-x`, separate from the `main` branch.

### **🔹 Creating and Switching to a New Branch in One Step**

```sh
git switch -c new-feature
```

### **🔹 Merging Changes Back to Main**

Once the feature is complete, merge it into the `main` branch:

```sh
git switch main
git merge feature-x
```

### **🔹 Deleting a Branch After Merging**

```sh
git branch -d feature-x
```

🔸 If the branch isn’t merged yet, use `-D` (capital D) to force-delete it.

---

# **3️⃣ Using Tags for Versioning Releases**

### **🔹 Creating a Tag for a Version**

```sh
git tag v1.0
```

This creates a lightweight tag at the latest commit.

### **🔹 Creating an Annotated Tag (Recommended)**

```sh
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0 release"
```

🔹 Annotated tags store extra information (author, date, message).

### **🔹 Listing All Tags**

```sh
git tag
```

### **🔹 Viewing Tag Details**

```sh
git show v1.0
```

### **🔹 Pushing Tags to a Remote Repository**

```sh
git push origin v1.0
```

To push **all** tags:

```sh
git push --tags
```

### **🔹 Deleting a Tag**

```sh
git tag -d v1.0
git push origin --delete v1.0  # Remove it from remote
```

---

# **4️⃣ Managing Remote Repositories for Versions**

### **🔹 Cloning a Remote Repository**

```sh
git clone <repo-url>
```

Creates a local copy of the remote repository.

### **🔹 Fetching the Latest Changes from Remote**

```sh
git fetch
```

Updates your local repository with remote changes **without merging** them.

### **🔹 Pulling the Latest Changes from Remote**

```sh
git pull origin main
```

Fetches and merges the latest updates from the `main` branch.

### **🔹 Pushing a New Branch to Remote**

```sh
git push origin new-feature
```

### **🔹 Deleting a Remote Branch**

```sh
git push origin --delete new-feature
```

---

# **5️⃣ Checking Out Previous Versions**

Sometimes, you need to switch to an older version to debug or revert changes.

### **🔹 List Previous Commits**

```sh
git log --oneline
```

Example output:

```
3f2c1e5 Fixed the bug in authentication
1a2b3c4 Updated README file
d4e5f6a Initial commit
```

### **🔹 Checkout an Old Commit (Detached HEAD Mode)**

```sh
git checkout <commit-hash>
```

⚠️ You are now in "detached HEAD" mode, meaning any changes **will not be saved** to any branch.

### **🔹 Creating a Branch from an Old Commit**

If you need to keep changes, create a branch:

```sh
git checkout -b fix-older-version <commit-hash>
```

### **🔹 Returning to the Latest Commit**

```sh
git switch main
```

---

# **6️⃣ Managing Hotfixes in Production**

When an urgent bug fix is needed, follow these steps:

### **🔹 Create a Hotfix Branch from the Stable Version**

```sh
git checkout -b hotfix-1.0 main
```

### **🔹 Apply Fixes & Commit**

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Critical bug fix"
```

### **🔹 Merge Hotfix into Main & Deploy**

```sh
git checkout main
git merge hotfix-1.0
git push origin main
```

### **🔹 Tag the New Fixed Version**

```sh
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Bug fix release"
git push origin v1.0.1
```

# **7️⃣ Best Practices for Version Management**

✅ **Use branches for features and bug fixes** instead of working directly on `main`  
✅ **Use descriptive branch names** (e.g., `feature-login`, `hotfix-crash`)  
✅ **Tag stable versions** (`v1.0`, `v2.0`) to track releases  
✅ **Regularly merge and delete old branches** to keep the repository clean  
✅ **Use remote repositories** to collaborate and store backup versions  
✅ **Keep commit messages clear** so history remains easy to follow
