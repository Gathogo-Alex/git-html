Most content in the web is text based thus one of the most commonly used interfaces in HTML is text-based. Some commonly used tags are:

1. Headings 
2. Paragraphs 
3. Bold, italicized and emphasized text
4. Comments
## Heading Elements

The **`<h1>`** to **`<h6>`**  elements represent six levels of section headings. `<h1>` is the highest section level and `<h6>` is the lowest. By default, all heading elements create a  block-level in the layout, starting on a new line and taking up the full width available in their containing block.

While using multiple `<h1>` elements on one page is allowed by the HTML standard (as long as they are not <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">nested</span>),  this is not considered a best practice. A page should generally have a single `<h1>` element that describes the content of the page (similar to the document's `<title>` element).

```html
<h1>This is Heading 1</h1> 
<h2>This is Heading 2</h2> 
<h3>This is Heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is Heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is Heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is Heading 6</h6>
```
### Usage notes on heading element

- Heading information can be used by user agents to construct a table of contents for a document automatically.
- Do not use heading elements to resize text. Please use the `CSS_ font-size` property.
- Do not skip heading levels: always start from `<h1>`, followed by `<h2>` and so on.
- Prefer using only one `<h1>` per page and nest headings without skipping levels.
## Paragraph

The `<p>` element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

## Bold, italicized and emphasized text

Sometimes we need to differentiate text in articles or text to show special types of text formatting. Here are some of the most common.

1. `<b>` - Bold text
2. `<strong>` - Important text
3. `<i>` - Italic text
4. `<em>` - Emphasized text
5. `<mark>` - Marked text
6. `<small>` - Smaller text
7. `<del>` - Deleted text
8. `<ins>` - Inserted text
9. `<sub>` - Subscript text
10. `<sup>` - Superscript text

### Notes

- `<b>` and `<i>` are used for styling only (bold and italic).
- `<strong>` and `<em>` convey meaning and importance, which can be useful for accessibility and SEO.
- The `<i>` tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name.

## Comments

Sometimes as developers we need comments to help document our source code. Note comments are not displayed by the browser. See the syntax below.

```html
<! -- This is a comment --- >
```
### Uses of comments

1. Adding explanations
2. Debugging code.
3. Organizing code
4. Notes to other devs
5. Hiding code for future use

## Articles

The `<article>` tag is used to define a self-contained piece of content that can be independently distributed or reused. It is commonly used for blog posts, news articles, forums, or other standalone content sections.

### Uses Of Articles

- **Blog posts**
- **News articles**
- **Forum discussions**
- **Product cards**
- **User comments**
- **Interactive widgets**

#####  **Key Features of `<article>`**

1. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Independence</span>: Each `<article>` should make sense on its own, even if removed from the main webpage.
2. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Multiple</span> `<article>` <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Elements</span>: A single document can contain multiple articles (e.g., a blog with multiple posts).
3. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Headings</span>:  Each `<article>` should have a heading (`<h1>` - `<h6>`) to clearly define its purpose.
4. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Nesting</span>:  Nested `<article>` elements represent related content (e.g., user comments inside a blog post).
5. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Author Information</span>:  The `<address>` tag can specify the article's author.
6. P<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">ublication Date</span>:  The `<time>` tag (with the `datetime` attribute) records the date and time of the content.
