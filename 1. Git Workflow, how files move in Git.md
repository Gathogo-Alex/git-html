Git organizes files into **four distinct areas**:

1️⃣ **Working Directory** → Where you create & modify files  
2️⃣ **Staging Area** → Where files are prepared for commit  
3️⃣ **Local Repository** → Where commits are stored locally  
4️⃣ **Remote Repository** → Where commits are pushed to GitHub/GitLab

### **📝 Git File Lifecycle Diagram**

This diagram shows how files move between different states in Git:

```
                    🖥️ WORKING DIRECTORY
         (Where you create and edit files)
                    │
        ┌───────────▼───────────┐
        │  git add <file>       │ (Stage changes)
        └───────────┬───────────┘
                    ▼
                📦 STAGING AREA
        (Files ready to be committed)
                    │
        ┌───────────▼───────────┐
        │  git commit -m "msg"  │ (Save to local repo)
        └───────────┬───────────┘
                    ▼
          🏠 LOCAL REPOSITORY (Git)
     (Files stored in version history)
                    │
        ┌───────────▼───────────┐
        │  git push origin main │ (Upload to GitHub)
        └───────────┬───────────┘
                    ▼
        🌍 REMOTE REPOSITORY (GitHub)
     (Files available for others to pull)
```

## **📌 Explanation of Each Git State**

|**State**|**Definition**|**Location**|**Command to Move to Next State**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Untracked**|New files that Git doesn’t track yet|**Working Directory**|`git add <file>`|
|**Unstaged**|Modified files not yet staged|**Working Directory**|`git add <file>`|
|**Staged**|Files added to staging (ready for commit)|**Staging Area**|`git commit -m "msg"`|
|**Committed**|Files stored in the **Local Repository**|**Local Repository**|`git push origin main`|
|**Pushed**|Files sent to **GitHub (Remote Repo)**|**Remote Repository**|Already in remote|

---

## **📌 Commands and Their Effects on File State**

|**Command**|**Effect**|**Moves File From → To**|
|---|---|---|
|`git add <file>`|Stages changes|**Working Directory → Staging Area**|
|`git commit -m "msg"`|Saves changes in local repo|**Staging Area → Local Repository**|
|`git push origin <branch>`|Uploads commits|**Local Repository → Remote Repository**|
|`git status`|Shows the current state|No movement|
|`git checkout -- <file>`|Restores file to last committed version|**Unstaged → Committed Version**|
|`git reset HEAD <file>`|Unstages a file|**Staging Area → Unstaged**|

## **📌 Example Walkthrough**

### **🎯 Scenario: Adding & Committing a New File**

Let's say you create and modify a file named `index.js`:

### **Step 1: Create a new file** (Untracked)

```sh
touch index.js   # Creates an untracked file
git status       # Shows index.js as untracked (in red)
```

**State:**  
✅ `index.js` is in the **Working Directory** (Untracked)

---

### **Step 2: Stage the file**

```sh
git add index.js   # Moves file to Staging Area
git status         # Shows index.js as staged (green)
```

**State:**  
✅ `index.js` is now in the **Staging Area** (Ready for commit)

---

### **Step 3: Commit the file**

```sh
git commit -m "Added index.js"  # Saves the file locally
git status                      # No changes (Clean working directory)
```

**State:**  
✅ `index.js` is now in the **Local Repository** (Committed)

---

### **Step 4: Push the file to GitHub**

```sh
git push origin main  # Uploads commits to GitHub
```

**State:**  
✅ `index.js` is now in the **Remote Repository (GitHub)**

---

## **📌 Git Status Example**

After modifying a file, you can check its state using:

```sh
git status
```

### **Possible Outputs**

#### **1️⃣ Untracked File (Not Added)**

```
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>" to include in what will be committed)

    index.js
```

#### **2️⃣ Staged File (Ready to Commit)**

```
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

    new file:   index.js
```

#### **3️⃣ Modified but Unstaged File**

```
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   index.js
```

---

## **📌 Undoing Mistakes**

|**Command**|**Effect**|
|---|---|
|`git checkout -- <file>`|Discards local changes, resets file to last committed state|
|`git reset HEAD <file>`|Removes file from staging (but keeps changes)|
|`git revert <commit>`|Creates a new commit that undoes a previous commit|
|`git reset --hard <commit>`|Completely removes commits (⚠️ Dangerous)|

---

## **📌 Common Issues & Fixes**

|**Issue**|**Solution**|
|---|---|
|Forgot to add a file?|`git add <file>`|
|Committed but forgot a file?|`git commit --amend`|
|Pushed the wrong commit?|`git revert <commit>`|
|Want to delete local changes?|`git checkout -- <file>`|
|Want to unstage a file?|`git reset HEAD <file>`|

---

## 🎯 **Key Takeaways**

✅ **`Working Directory`** → Where you edit files  
✅ **`Staging Area`** → Files ready for commit (`git add`)  
✅ **`Local Repository`** → Stores committed files (`git commit`)  
✅ **`Remote Repository`** → GitHub/GitLab (`git push`)
