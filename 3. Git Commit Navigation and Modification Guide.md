In this guide, you'll learn:

1. **How to move between commits** (checkout, reset, revert)
2. **How to change commits** (amend, rebase, cherry-pick)
3. **Best Git commit guidelines** 🚀

---

## **1. Moving Between Commits**

You can move between commits using `checkout`, `reset`, or `revert`.

### **A. Checkout (Temporary Switch to a Commit)**

If you want to **view a past commit** without making permanent changes, use:

```sh
git checkout <commit-hash>
```

To find the commit hash, run:

```sh
git log --oneline
```

To return to the latest commit:

```sh
git switch main
```

---

### **B. Reset (Move to a Previous Commit Permanently)**

If you want to **undo commits** and move your branch back:

- **Soft Reset:** Moves the branch but **keeps changes staged**
    
    ```sh
    git reset --soft <commit-hash>
    ```
    
- **Mixed Reset (Default):** Moves the branch and **unstages changes**
    
    ```sh
    git reset <commit-hash>
    ```
    
- **Hard Reset:** Moves the branch and **deletes changes**
    
    ```sh
    git reset --hard <commit-hash>
    ```
    

⚠️ **Warning:** `--hard` deletes all changes permanently!

---

### **C. Revert (Undo a Commit Without Losing History)**

If you've pushed a commit and want to undo it **without deleting history**, use:

```sh
git revert <commit-hash>
```

This creates a **new commit** that undoes the changes.

---

## **2. Changing Commits (Amend, Rebase, Cherry-Pick)**

### **A. Amending the Last Commit**

To change the last commit (e.g., update the message or add files):

```sh
git commit --amend
```

This opens an editor where you can modify the commit message.

If you just want to add more files:

```sh
git add new-file.txt
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

⚠️ **Use caution:** If the commit is already pushed, use `git push --force`.

---

### **B. Rebase (Modify Multiple Commits)**

Rebase lets you **rewrite commit history**.

To interactively modify the last 5 commits:

```sh
git rebase -i HEAD~5
```

You'll see something like this:

```
pick 123abc First commit
pick 456def Second commit
pick 789ghi Third commit
```

Change `pick` to:

- `reword` → Edit commit message
- `edit` → Modify the commit
- `squash` → Merge commits together

Save and follow instructions.

⚠️ **Rebasing rewrites history—don't use it on shared branches!**

---

### **C. Cherry-Pick (Apply a Specific Commit)**

To apply changes from a specific commit to your current branch:

```sh
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

This is useful for moving a fix from one branch to another.

---

## **3. Best Git Commit Guidelines**

### **✅ Write Meaningful Commit Messages**

- **Bad:** `"Fixed bug"`
- **Good:** `"Fix login issue when user enters invalid credentials"`

Follow this format:

```
[Type]: Short Summary

Detailed description of the change (if needed).
```

Example:

```
feat: Add dark mode toggle

Added a button to switch between light and dark mode. The styles adjust dynamically based on the user's preference.
```

### **✅ Use Atomic Commits**

Keep commits **small and focused** on one change at a time.

Bad:

```sh
git commit -m "Added login, signup, and fixed dashboard bug"
```

Good:

```sh
git commit -m "feat: Implement user login"
git commit -m "feat: Implement user signup"
git commit -m "fix: Resolve dashboard crash issue"
```

### **✅ Keep Your History Clean**

- Use `git rebase -i` to clean up messy commit history.
- Use `git commit --amend` for minor mistakes.
- Avoid unnecessary `merge commits`—use `git pull --rebase`.

# **Git `switch` vs `checkout` – Proper Use Cases**

## **1️⃣ `git switch` (For Branch Navigation)** 🏁

🔹 **Use `switch` for branch operations ONLY.**

### ✅ **Use Cases:**

- **Switch to an existing branch:**
    
    ```sh
    git switch main
    ```
    
- **Create and switch to a new branch:**
    
    ```sh
    git switch -c feature-branch
    ```
    
- **Switch back to the previous branch:**
    
    ```sh
    git switch -
    ```
    

💡 **Why `switch`?**  
✔️ Clearer & safer than `checkout`  
✔️ Only affects branches, avoiding file modifications

---

## **2️⃣ `git checkout` (For Commits & File Restoration)** 🔄

🔹 **Use `checkout` for handling commits and files.**

### ✅ **Use Cases:**

- **Move to a past commit (detached HEAD):**
    
    ```sh
    git checkout <commit-hash>
    ```
    
- **Restore a file to its last committed state:**
    
    ```sh
    git checkout -- file.txt
    ```
    

💡 **Why `checkout`?**  
✔️ Lets you explore old commits  
✔️ Useful for discarding unwanted file changes

---

### 🚀 **Key Takeaways**

✅ Use **`switch`** for branches 🚀  
✅ Use **`checkout`** for commits & file restoration 🔄
